# Spectral Graph Analysis

A work by [Ronald](https://github.com/huidr) & [Aditya](https://github.com/ThatFarziGamer)

## Abstract

Spectral graph theory can be used to analyze the topological
properties (e.g., connectivity) of graphs. Each graph has a
Laplacian matrix whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal
many properties of the graph. We look at discrete
mathematical (graph theoretical) models for biological
networks, then study some mathematics of spectral graph
theory and in particular, properties of the Laplacian.
